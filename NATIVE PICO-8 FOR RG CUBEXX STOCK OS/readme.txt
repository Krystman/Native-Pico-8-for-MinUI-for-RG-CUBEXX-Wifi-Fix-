Instructions:

1) Add your own copies of pico8.dat and pico8_dyn obtained from the latest Raspberry Pi release of Pico-8 to Splore.pak/pico-8/.

2) Drop Splore.sh and Splore.pak/ into the Roms/APPS/ folder of either of your SD cards.

3) Run Splore from App Center -> APPS on your device.

4) Splore and play!

5) To exit Pico-8, select Options from a game's menu (accessed with the START button) and select "Shutdown Pico-8".


Note: Make sure you are either connected to Wi-Fi or have at least one game in your Roms/PICO folder - otherwise you can get stuck inside Pico-8 and require a hard reset!
